game_concept_pow_gather_commanders_desc: "For the player, a character can only be assigned as [commander|E] if they are in the same location as the army they are being assigned to.

Using the button starts a travel towards the army, and upon arrival, the character will be assigned as [commander|E].\n\nShould the [commander|E] be removed from command for any reason, they will start a travel back home. If they have prisoners in transit, they will first travel to their liege's court to transfer the prisoners to the dungeons.\n\nBy default, travel events do not happen on those travels, but they can be enabled with the proper setting."
